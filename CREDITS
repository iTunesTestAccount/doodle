Doodle grew out of my response to Ruby Quiz 49 - "Lisp
Game":[http://www.rubyquiz.com/quiz49.html] and is in effect a ~very~
late entry to the justly renowned Quiz 67 -
"metakoans":[http://www.rubyquiz.com/quiz67.html]. I learnt a lot from
the answers to that quiz, in particular Christian Neukirchen's and
Florian Gross's solutions (though I took a different path). I've also
been inspired by Ara Howard's traits and attributes libraries.

RSpec[http://rspec.rubyforge.org/], autotest (part of the
ZenTest[http://www.zenspider.com/ZSS/Products/ZenTest/] suite) and

tools guys!
