= doodle to do list
== TODO Known bugs
- [X] loading from yaml should apply conversions 2008-03-24
- [X] sort out duplication of errors when calling validate! after
      setting incorrect value has already generated entry 2008-03-26
== TODO need some way of accessing containing object from attribute
- why?
  - to put errors on instance
- though this is somewhat tricky - can't use simple reference to
  parent as neither would be garbage collected (bkz of cycle -
  better check this)
== Errors collection
=== TODO should be simpler way of getting to errors collection
- the errors collection is for collecting all errors on an instance
  rather than raising an exception on the first error
- current way of collecting errors is not satisfactory
- need to get clearer idea of desired interaction
- errors need to be on the instance
- should clear errors before validation (or perhaps on accessing?)
- compare with AR
- errors on attributes should be collected at the instance level
- now not sure that Attributes should be Doodles - perhaps simpler
== TODO fix singleton & class init
- I'm not happy using the class_init directive
- may be better to treat singleton attributes differently, e.g. to
  interpret the init at definition time rather than on object
  initialization
- the question then is how do you know you're in a singleton? it seems
  to be one of those things that by checking to see if you are one,
  you become it
== TODO add typedef methods (e.g. date :name, string :name, etc.)
- [ ] how should this be presented?
  - class level directives (at attr_accessor level)
  - within block? to avoid too much namespace pollution
    - e.g. doodle do ... end
== TODO check memory usage
- all those closures - are they leaking?
- and DOODLES hash (are objects being finalised?)
- check garbage collection of attributes
== TODO profile performance against plain old attributes [0/4]]
and compare with:
- [ ] attr_accessor
- [ ] attributes
- [ ] traits
- [ ] fattr
== TODO Documentation [0/2]
- [ ] provide full example of before vs after 
      - i.e. write out in full what you'd have to do to get same
        functionality perhaps also using traits and fattr
- [ ] example of using doodle to generate classes 
- (e.g. write out optimised Ruby code rather than use framework)
i.e. I could use the information gathered to generate a source file
- could also be in other language (e.g. Java, SQL DDL, etc.)
  (see SQL tables definition example)
== TODO Integration
=== TODO add errors collection [1/1]
- compatibility with AR? do I need/want that?
- [X] make raise exception on invalid values optional
==== TODO formalize content of errors collection [/]
- [X] include attribute name
- [ ] do I want to save the call stack? probably
=== TODO compare with moose
=== TODO check compatibility with ActiveRecord
- may need to rename :attributes to :doodles or something similar to
  avoid name clash
- or to access through __doodle__ method
- also, validate! method, etc.
=== TODO Sequel
- doesn't work with sequel_model at moment - conflict over initialization
== Fixes
=== TODO fix messy code [0/3]
- [ ] parents
- [ ] collect_inherited
- [ ] embrace - maybe replace?
=== TODO simplify usage
class Foo < Doodle
end
class Bar
  include Doodling # or something similar
  include ModDoodle
  include Doodle::Methods
  include Doodle::BaseMethods
end

i.e. have a top-level class rather than module

== TODO reorganize library layout to follow newgem
