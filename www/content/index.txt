doodle is a Ruby gem for creating extended attribute accessors with defaults, conversions and validations.

doodle is eco-friendly - it does not globally modify Object, Class or Module, nor does it pollute instances with its own instance variables (e.g. it plays nice with yaml).

== features

* link[initialization]
** using positional arguments
** with named arguments
** by block
* link[defaults]
* link[initial values]
* [[validations.html|validation]] at attribute and class levels
* link[conversions] for attributes and classes
* link[collectors] to help in defining simple DSLs
* works for [[classes_and_singletons.html|classes, instances and singletons]]

Doodle also supports link[reflection], serialization to and from [[yaml.html|YAML]] and [[doodle-xml.html|XML]], and [[doodle-app.html|command line argument processing]].

== example

Putting all this together, you can initialize objects like this:

<<< xmp filename: eg-event.rb, sections: [use, output] >>>

from a definition like this:

<<< xmp filename: eg-event.rb, sections: definition >>>

== installation

$ sudo gem install doodle

or

<<< source lang: shell
C:\> gem install doodle
>>>

depending on which way you swing ;)

== compatibility

doodle has been tested with Ruby 1.8.6, 1.8.7, 1.9.1 and JRuby 1.1.6. Getting it to work with Rubinius is underway.
