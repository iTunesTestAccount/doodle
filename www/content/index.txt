doodle is a Ruby gem for creating extended attribute accessors
with defaults, conversions and validations.

<<< xmp filename: eg1.rb >>>

doodle is eco-friendly - it does not globally modify Object, Class or
Module, nor does it pollute instances with its own instance
variables<a href="#1">^^1^^</a> (e.g. it plays nice with yaml).

== features

* link[initialization]
** using positional arguments
** with named arguments
** by block
* link[defaults]
* link[initial values]
* [[validations.html|validation]] at attribute and class levels
* link[conversions] for attributes and classes
* link[collectors] to help in defining simple DSLs
* works for [[classes_and_singletons.html|classes, instances and singletons]]

Putting all this together, you can initialize objects like this:

<<< xmp filename: eg-event.rb, sections: [use, output] >>>

from a definition like this:

<<< xmp filename: eg-event.rb, sections: definition >>>

== installation

$ sudo gem install doodle

or

<<< source lang: shell
C:\> gem install doodle
>>>

depending on which way you swing ;)

== compatibility

doodle has been tested with Ruby 1.8.6, Ruby 1.9.0 and JRuby 1.1.6. It
has not yet been tested with Rubinius.

<a name="1">^^1^^</a> Not ~entirely~ true - doodle uses tricks under the hood to hide
its footprint. However, the visible effect is the same.
