Sometimes, you don't want ~default~ values set when the ~class~ is
~defined~ or recalculated every time. Instead you want ~initial~ values which
are set when the ~object~ is ~instantiated~. Also, default values are
fine for simple scalar objects, but can cause problems with aggregates
such as Arrays because you end up sharing them among all instances:

<<< xmp sections: use
require 'doodle'
#:use
class Event < Doodle
  has :locations, :default => []
end

e1 = Event()
e2 = Event()
e1.locations.object_id == e2.locations.object_id # =>
>>>

In these cases, use @init@ instead of @default@:

<<< xmp sections: use
require 'doodle'
#:use
class Event < Doodle
  has :locations, :init => []
end

e1 = Event()
e2 = Event()
e1.locations.object_id == e2.locations.object_id # =>
>>>

or you can specify the class:

<<< xmp sections: use
require 'doodle'
#:use
class Event < Doodle
  has :locations, :init => Array
end

e1 = Event()
e2 = Event()
e1.locations.object_id == e2.locations.object_id # =>
>>>

Internally, Doodle copies the {{{init}}} value by cloning it if given an instance or calling ~class~{{{.new}}} if given a class. Unlike
@default@, @init@ ~does~ create an instance variable.

However, we can set still the @date@ attribute to any value we like.

<<< xmp sections: use
require 'doodle'
#:define
class Event < Doodle
  has :start_date
  has :end_date, :default => proc { start_date + 1 }
end
#:use
event = Event :start_date => "Hello"
event.start_date # =>
event.end_date   # =>
>>>

To avoid this kind of inconsistency, we can restrict the kinds of
values the @date@ attribute will accept with link[validations].
