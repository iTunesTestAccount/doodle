[[http://configtoolkit.rubyforge.org/|configtoolkit]] is a described as a:

: package [that] makes sourcing information from (parsing) configuration files robust and easy!

It offers similar facilities to doodle, including:

* restricting the type of data
* generating parameter accessor methods
* easy creation of configuration files
* Ruby as a configuration language
* YAML loading and dumping
* Hash loading and dumping
* Custom data validation

It also provides:

* Overriding one configuration by another
* Custom format configuration files

Here an example file from the rubydocs:

<<< xmp filename: config-toolkit-machine-config.rb >>>

and a run:

<<< xmp filename: config-toolkit-run-machine-config.rb >>>

Let's see how we would implement this in doodle.

<<< xmp filename: doodle-machine-config.rb >>>

and a run:

<<< xmp filename: doodle-run-machine-config.rb >>>
