You can also use @has@ for class attributes:

<<< ruby
class Foo < Doodle
  class << self
    has :note, :default => "This is the Foo class"
  end
end
>>>

or singleton instances:

<<< ruby
foo = Foo.new
class << foo
  has :special, :default => 'This object is special'
end
p foo.special
# => 'This object is special'
>>>
