doodle is a Ruby gem for creating extended attribute accessors
with defaults, conversions and validations.

== example

The example below shows how to define an attribute with a validation
and a conversion:

<<< ruby
require 'rubygems'
require 'doodle'

class Life < Doodle
  ANSWER = 42
  has :answer do
    must "be #{ANSWER}" do |value|
      value == ANSWER
    end
    from String do |s|
      s.to_i
    end
  end
end

a = Life.new(:answer => "42")   # => #<Life:0x10aba6c @answer=42>
b = Life(41)                    # =>
# ~> -:16: Life.answer must be 42 - got Fixnum(41)
