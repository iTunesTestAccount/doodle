doodle is a Ruby gem for creating extended attribute accessors
with defaults, conversions and validations.

<<< ruby
require 'rubygems'
require 'doodle'

class Life < Doodle
  ANSWER = 42
  has :answer do
    must "be #{ANSWER}" do |value|
      value == ANSWER
    end
    from String do |s|
      s.to_i
    end
  end
end

a = Life.new(:answer => "42")   # => #<Life:0x10aba6c @answer=42>
b = Life(41)                    # =>
# ~> -:16: Life.answer must be 42 - got Fixnum(41)

>>>

doodle is eco-friendly - it does not globally modify Object, Class or
Module, nor does it pollute instances with its own instance variables[1]
(i.e. it plays nice with yaml).

== installation

$ sudo gem install doodle

or

<<< source lang: shell
C:\> gem install doodle
>>>

depending on which way you swing ;)

== compatibility

doodle has been tested with Ruby 1.8.6, Ruby 1.9.0 and JRuby 1.1.6. It
has not yet been tested with Rubinius.

[1] Not //entirely// true - doodle uses tricks under the hood to hide
its footprint. However, the visible effect is the same.
