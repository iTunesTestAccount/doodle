=== roots

doodle itself is a descendant of an idea I had for [[http://rubyquiz.com/quiz49.html|Lisp Game (Ruby Quiz #49)]] (original code [[http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/159275|here]]). I was also influenced by the famous [[http://rubyquiz.com/quiz67.html|metakoans quiz]].
