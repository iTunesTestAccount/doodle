=== by kind

<<< xmp filename: eg-validations1.rb, sections: definitions >>>

Doodle uses @kind_of?@ to test the value, so @kind@ can be set to any module (e.g. @Enumerable@), class or superclass that makes sense for your application.

If you now try to initialize @Event#date@ with something that isn't a @Date@:

<<< xmp filename: eg-validations1.rb, sections: use >>>

you'll get a @Doodle::ValidationError@ exception:

<<< xmp filename: eg-validations1.rb, sections: output >>>

=== attribute validations using @must@

To specify a validation on an attribute, use @must@ inside the attribute's definition block:

<<< xmp filename: eg-validations2.rb, sections: all >>>

The @must@ block should return @true@ if the value is valid, @false@ otherwise. A failed validation will raise a @Doodle::ValidationError@ exception.

Attribute validations happen ~before~ the instance variable is changed.

=== instance level validations

You can also specify validations for the object as a whole:

<<< xmp filename: eg-validations3.rb, sections: all >>>

Note that you don't need to project the value into the block but you can if you like - its value is the object instance itself.

Object level validations occur ~after~ all instance variables have been set.

=== deferring validation

Sometimes you need to update attributes in a way that would temporarily cause the object state to be invalid. If you try to simply update an doodle attribute in such a way as to cause the instance to be invalid, Doodle will throw an exception:

<< xmp filename: eg-defer-validation-1.rb, sections: use >>

To allow the object to be in a temporarily invalid state, use {{{obj.doodle.defer_validation}}}:

<< xmp filename: eg-defer-validation-2.rb, sections: use >>

Of course, if at the end of the {{{defer_validation}}} block, the object is still invalid, Doodle will still throw an exception:

<< xmp filename: eg-defer-validation-3.rb, sections: use >>
