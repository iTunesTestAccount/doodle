=== by kind

<<< xmp filename: eg-validations1.rb, sections: definitions >>>

Doodle uses @kind_of?@ to test the value, so @kind@ can be set to any module
(e.g. @Enumerable@), class or superclass that makes sense for your application.

If you now try to initialize @Event#date@ with something that isn't a @Date@:

<<< xmp filename: eg-validations1.rb, sections: use >>>

you'll get a @Doodle::ValidationError@ exception:

<<< xmp filename: eg-validations1.rb, sections: output >>>

=== attribute validations using @must@

To specify a validation on an attribute, use @must@ inside the attribute's definition block:

<<< xmp filename: eg-validations2.rb, sections: all >>>

The @must@ block should return @true@ if the value is valid, @false@
otherwise. A failed validation will raise a @Doodle::ValidationError@
exception.

Attribute validations happen ~before~ the instance variable is changed.

=== instance level validations

You can also specify validations for the object as a whole:

<<< xmp filename: eg-validations3.rb, sections: all >>>

Note that you don't need to project the value into the block but you
can if you like - its value is the object instance itself.

Object level validations occur _after_ all instance variables have been
set.

=== validating data loaded from a yaml source

YAML::load sets an object's instance variables directly, bypassing its
attribute accessors. In a Doodle context, this means that loading from
a yaml source bypasses attribute validations.

You can apply validations explicitly by using the @validate!@ method
(the exclamation mark denotes that this method can raise an
exception). @validate!@ returns the validated object on success, so
you can get a validated object from a yaml source using the following:

<<< ruby
foo = YAML::load(yaml_source).validate!
>>>

The following will raise an exception, complaining that 'name' is missing:

<<< xmp filename: eg-validations4.rb, sections: all >>>
