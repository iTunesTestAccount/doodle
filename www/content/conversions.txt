Even when you want to restrict an attribute to a particular kind, it
is often convenient to allow initialization from values that can be
converted to the target type. To do this in Doodle, use the @from@
method inside an attribute's definition block:

<<< xmp filename: conversions1.rb, sections: [definition, use] >>>

You can pass multiple classes or modules to @from@ - it's up to you to
ensure that it makes sense to do so. For example:

<<< ruby
from Symbol, String do |name|
  Event(:name => name.to_s)
end
>>>

@from@ also works on the class level:

<<< xmp filename: conversions2.rb, sections: [d1, class_from, d2] >>>

<<< xmp filename: conversions2.rb, sections: [use] >>>

Note: the class level interface to @from@ may change in a future version.
