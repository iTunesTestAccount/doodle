title: in ruby 1.9.1 in rspec, classes are created in anonymous class - this causes problems with the factory function
desc: When defining a class in rspec before :each, it is created in an anonymous class - this causes a class named, e.g., Foo to get the name "#<Class:0x10c352c>::Foo". Unless I define the classes as "class ::Foo", i.e., top-level namespace, this causes the factory function to break. So, I can't define factory functions in an anonymous class
