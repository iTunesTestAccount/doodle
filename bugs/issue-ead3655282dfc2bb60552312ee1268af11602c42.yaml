    Instead of:
      doodle_attributes
    use
      doodle.attributes, .validations, .conversions, etc.
    
    I have to be careful however regarding scopes. Also, collect_inherited
    will probably need to be refactored to work inside DoodleInfo using
    doodled object's parents, rather than its own
