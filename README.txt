== DESCRIPTION:

Doodle is a Ruby library for simplifying the definition of Ruby
classes by making attributes and their properties more declarative.

Doodle is eco-friendly: it does not globally modify Object, Class or
Module, nor does it pollute instances with its own instance variables
(i.e. it plays nice with yaml).

Doodle has been tested with Ruby 1.8.6 and JRuby 1.1. It does not yet
work with Ruby 1.9 or Rubinius.

Please feel free to post bug reports, feature requests, and any
comments or discussion topics to the doodle Google group: 
http://groups.google.com/group/ruby-doodle

== FEATURES:

* initialization
  * using positional arguments
  * with named arguments
  * by block
* defaults
* initial values
* validation at attribute and class levels
* conversions for attributes and classes
* collectors to help in defining simple DSLs
* works for classes, instances and singletons

== SYNOPSIS:

=== Example 1

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'date'
  require 'doodle'

  class DateRange < Doodle 
    has :start_date do
      default { Date.today }
    end
    has :end_date do
      default { start_date }
    end
  end

  dr = DateRange.new
  dr.start_date                   # => #<Date: 4909159/2,0,2299161>
  dr.end_date                     # => #<Date: 4909159/2,0,2299161>

=== Example 2

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'date'
  require 'doodle'
  require 'doodle/utils' # for try

  class DateRange < Doodle 
    has :start_date, :kind => Date do
      default { Date.today }
      from String do |s|
        Date.parse(s)
      end
      must "be >= 2000-01-01" do |d|
        d >= Date.parse('2000-01-01')

      default { start_date }
      from String do |s|

    from String do |s|
      m = /(\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2})\s*(?:to|-|\s)\s*(\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2})/.match(s)
      if m
        self.new(*m.captures)
      else
        raise Exception, "Cannot parse date: '#{s}'"
      end
