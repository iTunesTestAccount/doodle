== Initialization

=== Notes
Something I've just realised (which should have been obvious of
course) is that definitions made in the singleton scope cannot use any
of the features enabled during initialization (for example, validation
& defaults).

I've put in a class_init method which does a basic initializaton after
calling the block - but don't want to repeat initialize_from_hash -
(but borks on arg_order if I call that)

Need to address this in a more systematic way

=== DONE Initial values :init => value/proc {} ?

   Do I need an initialize with default method? i.e. set an initial
value - a different concept to the default value? i.e. set only once
if no other value supplied.

This came up as I was using generated ids - I had to do this:

  symbol :identifier
  
  def initialize(*a, &b)
    self.identifier = "#{self.class}##{self.class.new_id}"
    super
  end

See [[file:~/interactive-fiction/world-model/world-model.rb::symbol%20identifier][file:~/interactive-fiction/world-model/world-model.rb::symbol identifier]]

where I think I'd rather do this:

  symbol :identifier, :init => proc { "#{self.class}##{self.class.new_id}" }

Note, this is not the same as the :default (which only gets 'realised'
when accessed). Perhaps I need to change the way :default works. Also
note, this has the same problem as :default in singletons - it won't
happen because there is no :initialize call (except that I can
interpret it on definition in singleton classes - but then I need to
know that I'm being executed in context of singleton class - that one
again... hmmm)

=== DONE Positional args																									:test:

Positional args should follow order in which attributes have been
defined. Doesn't seem to be doing that at the moment. So I need tests

Added =arg_order= to specify order of args in initialize()

Fixed [[file:lib/doodle.rb::def%20parents][parents]] & [[file:lib/doodle.rb::def%20collect_inherited%20message][collect_inherited]] to return inherited classes in
right order

=== TODO Fix parents and collect_inherited
Fix [[file:lib/doodle.rb::def%20parents][parents]] & [[file:lib/doodle.rb::def%20collect_inherited%20message][collect_inherited]] - they are a mess - need to tidy
up/refactor/rethink/clarify/etc.
=== TODO Optional args																										:test:
What to do about optional arguments? 

==== reject
raise error if unrecognised arguments in init

==== accept
stash away somewhere so can be retrieved later

==== ignore
quietly discard - this is probably the least appealing option - don't
want to lose info without raising alert (e.g. could be misspelling)

=== TODO Inherited attributes                                             :test:

Need better tests of inherited attributes - last two problems were to
do with this

=== TODO Benchmarking																								 :benchmark:

Profiling and benchmarking 
- how much does this cost? 
- where can I improve it?

Added profile task to rake:
  $ rake profile

=== TODO Document how it works                                             :doc:

In particular, the way inheritance works (mainly for my own benefit :).

=== TODO Get 100% coverage																						:test:cov:

- [ ] need to test inherited validations and conversions

=== TODO Validation of defaults
See [[file:lib/doodle.rb::bump%20off%20validate%20for%20Attributes%20maybe%20better%20way%20of%20doing][Attribute validation in doodle.rb]]

- Defaults are not validated - should they be?
- Also, because defaults are set on access, validation sets them - do
  I want this? means that e.g. setting a variable after initialization
  can cause validation error (see "should allow changing start_date without
  changing end_date" in spec/validation_2.rb) because now start_date >
  end_date (rather than just updating start_date and leaving end_date
  as default derived value) - this might be quite tricky to fix
- if I don't set default on access, then array defaults can be updated
  without setting instance_variable (which means the update is lost)
- 2008-03-16: this has been addressed with :init => value option -
  defaults no longer create an instance variable

=== TODO Validate array members

- do I want to enforce kind of array members? 'typesafe' containers?
  - e.g. ensure that all members of array are Things
  - 2008-03-16: this is partly addressed with :collect interface

=== DONE Singleton attribute defaults

- because singleton objects do not have an initialize which is called,
  defaults don't work (I think this is the reason) - fix this

- now use class_init which will initialise from :init => values

=== TODO Conversions in initialization

I have Thing.from(other) - perhaps I could apply conversions in
initialization so I can do Thing.new(other)
- would need to be careful about infinite regression
- need to test conversions on input

=== TODO Factory functions

Some wrinkles with factory functions - not always defined properly?
Anonymous classes, etc. Need to test in modules, etc.

==== What is a factory function?

A factory function is a function that has the same name as
a class which acts just like class.new. For example:

  Cat(:name => 'Ren')

is the same as:

  Cat.new(:name => 'Ren')

The notion of a factory function is somewhat contentious [xref
ruby-talk], so while you get them automatically when deriving from
Doodle::Base, you need to explicitly ask for them by including Factory
in your base class if you use Doodle by including Doodle::Helper:

  class Base < Doodle::Base
  end

  class Dog < Base
    has :name
  end

  stimpy = Dog(:name => 'Stimpy')

but

  class Cat
    include Doodle::Helper
    include Doodle::Factory
    has :name
  end

  ren = Cat('Ren')
etc.


=== DONE Collector

  has :locations, :init => [], :collect => Location

should define a method :location like:

  def location(*args, &block)
    locations << Location.new(*args, &block)
  end

  has :locations, :init => [], :collect => {:location => Location}

=== TODO Nested hash initialization?
=== TODO Call initialization blocks on instantiation?
i.e. use the fact that we have deferred processing to call the typedef
blocks on object initialization rather than on definition? Would this
work? Would get around the default vs init treatment of procs maybe?

== what else?

=== purpose of Attribute class

- defines constraints on an object when a member of class
- not standalone - rules it has to follow as member of set
- maybe Constraint would be a better name
- whereas object_validation is about whole object validity
- attribute validity is as part of another object

=== initialization [3/3]

- [X] block init
- [X] init from hash - error handling
- [X] positional args

=== attribute accessors [2/2]

- [X] getter_setter
- [X] default does not create an instance_variable
- [X] init does create an instance_variable

=== defaults [4/4]

Unless a default is specified, an attribute is assumed to be required.
You can specify :default => nil :init => nil if that is what you want.

- [X] default value
-- :default => value
-- :default => proc {}
-- do default value end
-- do default do ... end end
- [X] optional if has :default or :init, required otherwise
- [X] enforce required
- [X] When handling defaults, want to be able to execute default block
      in context of instance, e.g.

        class DateRange < Doodle::Root 
          has :start_date, :kind => Date do
            default { Date.today }
          end
          has :end_date, :kind => Date do
            default { start_date }
          end
        end

        dr = DateRange.new
        dr.end_date # => Date.today

=== validation and conversion [7/7]

- [X] kind
- [X] validations
- [X] conversions
- [X] from
- [X] must
- [X] validate (Attribute validation)
- [X] validate! (Object validation)
- notes
  - (would rather have 'should' instead of 'must' but that's taken by rspec :/)
  - use ancestor conversion if direct not available
=== user defined datatypes

These are not part of Doodle (yet) as there are issues involved with
defining your own datatype declarations that I have not yet fully
worked out. (I will probably end up using a separate block to enable
datatype directives.)

However, to see what can be done, see
[[file:~/scratch/doodle/trunk/examples/datatype-defs.rb]],
[[file:examples/datatypes.rb][file:~/scratch/doodle/trunk/examples/datatypes.rb]] and
[[file:examples/application-model.rb][file:~/scratch/doodle/trunk/examples/application-model.rb]] 

== DONE Hide behind extension __doodle__

Rather than pollute the instance variable namespace with my variables,
I've chosen to hang all Doodle related info off another structure,
i.e. the method :__doodle__ and access everything through that

This gives access to a DoodleInfo object which is stored centrally
inside the DoodleInfo::DOODLES hash (keyed by object_id).

== DONE Attribute has :init => value as well as default

this is different to default - this sets the value in initialization
and so creates an instance variable whereas default never creates an
instance variable

=== TODO Specs
